# Data Preprocessing and Text Generation with GPT-2

This notebook guides users through data preprocessing and text generation using the GPT-2 model. The goal is to empower users to process text data effectively and leverage GPT-2 for creative text generation. The generated text can be used as prompts for image generation models like StableDiffusionXL from HuggingFace, DALL-E, Midjourney, and others available on HuggingFace. The notebook covers the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Load a dataset from a CSV file containing text descriptions.

2. **Text Cleaning:**
   - Utilize a custom cleaning function to remove special characters, numbers, and whitespaces.
   - Convert text to lowercase, tokenize, remove stopwords, and apply stemming for refined text data.

3. **Attribute Selection:**
   - Focus on structured data attributes, check for specific columns, and handle missing values.
   - Scale values using Min-Max scaling to standardize the data for further analysis.

4. **Text Generation with GPT-2:**
   - Introduce GPT-2 for text generation.
   - Employ the Transformers library to fine-tune GPT-2 on a specific dataset of text prompts.

5. **Training and Saving the Model:**
   - Outline the training process, specify training arguments, and collate data for language modeling.
   - Provide steps to fine-tune GPT-2 and save the model for future use.


We express our gratitude to the open-source libraries and datasets used in this notebook, including Pandas, NLTK, Transformers, and the GPT-2 model, mainly HuggingFace. So much love.
